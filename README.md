# Chattfy
Chattfy is a real-time chat web application developed with Django. It uses web sockets to allow real-time smooth communications between two or more users via a persistent web connection. Moreover, HTMX is used and  contributes to a smooth experience by 
allowing partial page updates in real-time. Here's what the main page of the app looks like (which displays an example of chat rooms with multiple users, even though private messaging is also supported):
